<p>I guess that the term &#8216;resilience&#8217; has been around a while in the context of energy and agricultural systems, but I&#8217;ve only just heard about it. The essential idea is that building our infrastructure to be sustainable is not enough; we must build it to be resilient against shocks and disruptions that may occur through war, natural disasters, environmental change, etc.</p> <p>As this article states it, it&#8217;s about &#8220;paying attention to where we are most vulnerable, and then taking steps to build redundancy and adaptability into our systems&#8221;.</p>

Today&#8217;s interesting and devastating fact: the Aral Sea, once the world&#8217;s 4th largest lake, rivaling Lake Superior in size, is now all but dried up.</p> <p>This TED talk by Jonathan Foley outlines the problem well with plenty of quick facts and graphics. Towards the end he begins to outline the path toward a solution, but it&#8217;s apparent that we still have a long way to go.</p>
