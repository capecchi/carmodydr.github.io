<div class="post">
<p>In an effort to expand my skill toolkit (and, tangentially, make myself more employable) I’ve been participating in an online course through <a href="www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> on data science.</p>

<p>The course is nearing its completion, and the final material of the course is on data visualization. As an active researcher, data visualization is a core part of what I do. It is really the only way that I can draw any meaning from the data that I generate, and it is the only way that I can communicate that meaning to other people. So the need for visualization is clear to me, as are many of the basics.</p>

<p>That said, making <em>good</em> visualizations is something that is not often stressed. Yes, a figure should be readable and present things accurately, but once those basic criteria are met, it is often assumabely on the consumer of the figure to interpret it and extract the important information. Many of the small and subtle details that make a visualization both beautiful and self-evident do not really enter into the mind of a practicing scientist. A broad generalization, certainly, but I’ve seen enough crowded and confusing plots to know that it has some truth to it. As a restul, I’ve become pretty interested in what goes into an <strong>effective</strong> data visualization. In my attempts to learn, practice, and improve, I hope to lay out some of what I’m doing here.</p>

<p>In one of the lectures, Cecilla Aragon, who is a professor at the University of Washington, introduces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Bertin">Jacque Bertin</a>’s list of fundamental visual attributes. These are attributes that are important to work with whenever constructing a visualization. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Position</li>
  <li>Size</li>
  <li>Value</li>
  <li>Texture</li>
  <li>Color</li>
  <li>Orientation</li>
  <li>Shape</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, these are elements that anyone who makes a lot of plots knows and probably takes for granted. Seeing them all named is the first step towards being able to use them more effectively. Hopefully I’ll be more conscious of these things in my future work.</p>

<p>There’s a visual table that demonstrates some of these properties at <a href="http://understandinggraphics.com/visualizations/information-display-tips/">understandinggraphics.com</a>.</p>
