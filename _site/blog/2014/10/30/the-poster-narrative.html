<div class="post">
<p>I’ve been at the big annual plasma physics conference, the APS Division of Plasma Physics meeting. One of the main segments of the meeting is the poster session, which includes groups of about 100 posters for two daily 3-hour long sessions — one morning session and one afternoon session. During these poster sessions the presented stands by their poster and waits to attract visitors, and then proceeds to describe their research. The main idea of having a poster, rather than a talk, is that it allows for conversation and discussion between people, a huge element of research. The poster provides visual cues and more details for this discussion.</p>

<p>Often, posters are constructed in the way that we were taught to think in elementary school essays and science fairs. This is epitomized in the ‘five paragraph’ format for essays, and in the structure of a poster it might look something like this:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/simple-poster.png" alt="simple poster" style="align: center" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>It’s a very linear presentation. The problem, though, is that people don’t often read a poster in a linear way. As I’ve been wandering around the conference and persuing the posters, I’ve been thinking about how this format, and about how my poster compares to others and what, in the end, constitutes a <em>good</em> poster. As always, the way to answer this question is to first ask the questions: ‘<strong>who is my audience?</strong>’ and ‘<strong>what information am I trying to convey?</strong>’ There might be a couple of answers for these, and so the poster might end up actually serving several different functions. </p>

<p>On one level, there are your closest collaborators and colleagues. Although you have probably already discussed these issues at length with these folks, a poster session can provide the opportunity to delve into your research questions with renewed vigor. These people are interested in the gritty details, and having these details on hand — in the form of plots and equations and references — can can help to make these discussions more productive.</p>

<p>Another level might be those people whose work is tangentially related to yours. They understand many of the basics, but they don’t have the familiarity with the details that you do, and they probably don’t care about them as much as you do. Focus too much on these details and you risk losing the interest of these people, and they will be ignoring your explanations and instead looking for the next opportunity to make an exit.</p>

<p>The most general level will be people who have very little knowledge of your subject at all, but might just be wandering around the posters looking for interesting ideas. They are at the same conference, so they must share some kind of similar background with you, but if you try to describe anything in too much detail all you get is a blank stare. What can you offer to these people? I think the best thing to do is to give them a single sentence that concisely expresses the basic idea of your research and why its interesting and important. If all they take away from your poster is that single sentence, then you have succeeded.</p>

<p>Ignore any of these audiences and you miss out on an opportunity to have some good discussion. So how do you hit all these levels? Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide a good, short summary to effectively convey the main idea in one sentence. This forms a general framework that allows the viewer to then fill in any particular details in which they may be interested. </li>
  <li>Construct the poster in such a way that there is an obvious narrative. The layout of the poster should lead the viewer through the narrative in a step-by-step process, providing bite-size pieces of information.</li>
  <li>Be as visual as possible. People are hesitant to read, and reading is a slow way to convey something anyway. Plots and cartoons can often do a much better job.</li>
  <li>Details and extra information should be included on a secondary level, easily ignorable unless someone wants to delve in deeper. </li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps a good way to structure the poster is then to think of it as a multi-tiered narrative. Any person can come along and read your poster on the level that is most appropriate to their background and level of interest.</p>

<p>This is not the way that I have been approaching my posters, but I think I’ll give it a try next time I get the chance.</p>
