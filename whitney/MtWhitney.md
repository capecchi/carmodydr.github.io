Mt Whitney is the highest mountain in the lower 48, the top


It was at Ben's suggestion. I don't remember if he had mentioned it before he left camp or not, but a text from him was the invitation, and I, looking for some adventure to mix into my life and being often impulsive, replied yes, without really considering the nature of the mountain and whether my own particular set of skills were up to the challenge. On a Monday Ben called and issued an ultimatum of sorts about the trip. He had to pick up the permits, and so he had to know whether I was in, and who else might be. It was lunch at that time, and I was out on the deck with plenty of other instructors, including the two I had just been discussing Whitney with: Paul and Kyle. All of us said we were in. None of us knew what we were in for. I am in my very nature an anxious person, a worrier, a planner. I get it from my parents: my mother an analytically minded neurotic work-a-holic, and my father a slightly OCD marine corps logistics officer. I have confidence in my abilities, and so in many situations I throw planning out the window, preferring to instead rely on my knowledge and skills and creative problem solving abilities. But for larger, more uncertain challenges I obsessively plan and research and visualize the inumerable ways that something can go wrong and I might end up dead or injured. I read weather reports: late week snow, perhaps as much as a foot on the ridge and around 6 inches at our chosen campsite at 12000 feet. I read about the dos and do-nots of glissading, and I skim several stories of people who have died in recent years from uncontrolled snowy slides off of rocky cliff ledges, some stories of which took place on the very mountain we are setting off to climb. We are unprepared for such an ascent, or descent, lacking both the proper gear and the knowledge and experience to use it. I call an outfitter in Lone Pine to ask about equipment rental. Ice axes are no, crampons are yes, but the crampons require stiff mountaineering boots, boots which none of us have. The footwear that I've got, the closest appropriate choice, are a beat up pair of old leath boots that I picked up at a thriftstore back in Madison. The leather is cracked and dried, the tread is all buuut completely worn away. They are wholly inappropriate for the task at hand, but damn it if they aren't comfortable as hell and only put me back $12. Snow boots they aren't, but I know that with a decent pair of socks I can walk all day in them with a pack on my back.

I spent the week reading trip reports, double checking the gear I was bringing, and developing my mind towards the eventuality that we make it up to the switchbacks and have to turn around. I told Paul that I was prepared for that, that if the conditions were sketchy I would turn back, if not saving face then at least returning with life and all limbs. I knew these conditions in my heard, but the actual situation required to pull a hairpin turn and retreat was only a vague scenaio, one which I hoped I could recognize if it came along. The complicated wrench in this forward thinking plan was Ben, whom I had only known for five months but who I could already tell was a gung-ho spirit, and I half suspected/ half knew that he would push hard for the top, counting more strongly on his own confidence and more plentiful experience than on the lack of these things in the rest of the crew. I knew also, crucially, my own tendency to get drawn in by the willpower of others, to push aside my own anxieties and continue forward because it was easier than telling someone that I wanted to turn back.

## Departure

Friday came around, the last schoolbus of children left the camp, and Paul, Kyle, and I gathered in the staff dining hall to collect ourselves for the trip. We had a borrowed ice axe, no crampons, and Paul had been piecing together borrowed gear from a variety of people around camp, picking up a sleeping bag not ten minutes before we were setting to take off.

We had our gear collected on the tables in the dining area and a few grocery bags full of junk food and fruit from the camp larder. Grey skies outside had been casting drifting snow onto the camp all morning, but it had all settled down around noon. This lull turned out to be only temporary, and as we were about to leave the precipitation started falling again, dropping a snowy hail with the consistency of Dippin' Dots ice cream and the traction of a greased up slip n' slide. The three of us loaded up my car while a layer of wintry mix collected on the ground. I had a pair of tire chains in my car, so we decided it best to toss them on until we made it down the mountain and onto clear roads. I had never used the chains before, and for fifteen minutes we tried to wrap and link the chains. The chains, which had existed in the trunk of the car for months if not years without a single use, seemed to be too small for the job. Now, tires to match my boots, we decided to set out, hoping that once we made it back down to the highway we could find it relatively precipitation free. Procedding trepidously down the steep street, I tested the brakes, only to find the wheels locking and the car sliding on the thin icy layer that stood between us and the gritty traction of the open road. I was uncomfortable with the trip already, and we had made it a total of a hundred feet from the start. I pulled the plug. We were turning around. I tried to shift the car into a driveway to pull a three point turn and bring us back, but we just drifted past the driveway entrance and further down the road. The only possibility left to us was to continue aon and hope the road conditions improved before we found ourselves roof-side down in a ditch or tumbling bumper over bumper down a steep hillside. Continuing on for another five hundred feet brought us further down the mountain, down to where the snow faded away and the road cleared. We were clear to move ahead. We followed the highway through the numerous twists and turns, down the mountain, through the cloud layer, and out into the sunshine of the inland empire. Redlands, San Bernadino, and eventually onto the straight line conveyor belt of 395, carrying us to our destination of Lone Pine and Whitney Portal. 

We arrived in Lone Pine as the sun was setting, but now we needed to drive out to Whitney Portal, 15 miles and 5000 feet up in the mountains. Cell service was poor up there, and so we hd only been receiving sporadic text message updates from Ben, who was somewhere up there trying to find us a campsite for the night. Driving that way took us past the Alabama Hills, huge hilly fields of large red boulders, and eventually up the winding mountain road. Darkness had fallen by this time, and our surroundings were mostly obscured by the night, but it was apparent that large monolithic walls had surrounded us on our drive to the campgrounds, giant granite faces. At the entrance to one of the campgrounds we found Ben parked with his headlights on. There were a few open campsites, so we grabbed one and settled in for the night.

## Day 1

The trail from Whitney Portal to the summit climbs about 6000 feet over the course of about 11 miles. Completing the trip in a day, 22 miles round trip, requires good fitness, an early start, and perfect conditions. For those not so daring, there are two camps along the way to split the journey. Outpost Camp, at 10000 feet elevation and 3.5 miles from the trailhead, and Trail Camp, 6.5 miles in and at 12000 feet. Our plan was to make our way to Trail Camp on day one and push for the summit the following day. 

At the trailead we weighed our packs and took some time to distribute the weight more democratically. After that we were off, one foot in front of the other, ascending the winding trail. We were well acclimated, having lived at 5000 feet for the last several months, and the miles ticked away. Just past (Lone Pine Lake), at about 2.5 miles in, we passed into the Whitney Zone. We took our first break, admired the swath of pines in which he had paused and gazed up at the huge granite walls that surrounded us. The rock seemed enormous and impenetrable, but with any luck we would soon be achieving those heights and higher. Further down the trail we passed through the meadow that marks Outpost Camp. As the trail marched higher we startd encountering snow, which in some places obscurred the trail and made for slushy travel.

Every group of people we met along the way told us that they had turned back before reaching the summit. For some the altitude had stopped them, for others the slof up the mountain and through deep snow had taked too long and there had been no time to venture on. Although worrisome, our timing was better than theirs. Snow has been steadily melting since the storm, reducing some parts of the trail to puddles of slush and mud but the clearing the way for further travel. We arrived at Trail Camp to find snow three to four inches deep in some parts but patchy overall, not at all the six inches that was said to have blanketed it only a day or two prior. There was even a clear patch, an obviously recently used campsite, where we were ale to clear away a bit more snow and fit two tents side by side. At 12000 feet and with hardly any signs of vegetation, it was certainly the most rugged camoing I had ever done. And even at that altitude there were still large granite peaks that rose up on all sides, like Mt. Muir, a craggy prominence just south of Whitney, itself over 14000 feet. The setting sun fell right over top of Muir, balancing ono top of the peak before disappearing behind. As darkness arrived the temperatures began to drop. Out of a single bowl the four of us shared a luxurious dinner of gnocchi and ramen and then dove into our sleeping bags. Since my water supply was running low I stuffed some snow into my water bottle and brought into my sleeping bag with me, but I had either used too much snow or my body never produced enough warmth, and throughout the night the bottle was merely a cold rock that I had to toss and turn around. The night also brought enormous gusts of wind that threatened to rip us and our ten off the ground and drive us into the rocks. I slept, but fitfully.

## Day 2

 Morning arrived with a 5:30 AM alarm, but the anticipation of the cold and dark kept us confined to our bags. I was well mummified in my bag, only exposing my nose and mouth to breath, but the frigid air that I felt awaiting me did little to support further action. Cross tent conversation confirmed the group decision to hit the snooze button.

The mountain was waiting, however, and time would not, so as the sky brightened with the coming dawn we arrived at the inevitable. The deliberate decision to remove oneself from the warm and comfortable embrace of a bed and step out into the cold, dark pre-dawn morning is one of the most difficult aspects of a trip like this one, as predictable as it is unavoidable. I stomped around in my boots as we heated water for breakfast, struggling to maintain feeling in my toes, and then to regain it. Slowly the sun began to creep up over the mountains to the east, bringing with it a feeling of vitality, if not yet of warmth. Directly to our west was the climb up to the ridge. There existed two options for that section. Ascend the steep incline of the snow chute, which required the use of crampons and ice axes, or make our way up the series of switchbacks, which were also under a healthy layer of snow. Lacking the technical gear, our choice was obvious. 

At the base of the switchbacks Ben gave the rest of us our first and only lesson in self-arrest. Our tools were poor. Paul carried the borrowed ice axe, Ben brought two beat up trekking poles, one of which he gave to Kyle, and I had with me a sturdy walking stick found somewhere along the trail on our way up. We learned to keep the tool on the uphill side as we walked, learned to step firmly and check our footing, practicing falling and catching ourselves on our gear to prevent a slide. It was two minutes of scant preparation, and if anything it drove into my mind the necessity of turning around if I ever felt I was out of my element. The very bottom of the switchbacks were too covered in snow to be practically possible, so we opted to skip them in favor of a short and steep snowy incline. There were already some tracks where people has ventured in the last day or two. Ben easily climbed up, Paul behind him, but as I made my way up the poor traction of my boots combined with my own poor stepping skills caused me to slide backwards with almost every other step. It was slow progress, but I eventually made it up by occasionally crawling on my hands and knees. Somewhere on the incline I swapped my stick for Kyle's trekking pole to make the going a little easier, and after fifteen minutes or so we had joined up with the others. So far our day had been full of nothing but delays. We had left camp at about 6:30 AM, and it was now an hour later and we had barely even started up the switchbacks. There was still plenty of daylight left, but if we meant to attain the summit and hike back out to the cars then we needed to make better progress.

Although the conditions of the switchbacks were slightly better than the snow field we had just marched up, the going was still slow. Tracks were left from a group who had broken trail the day before, but the only group we talked to who had attempted to ascend via the switchbacks, rather than the snow chute, had turned back, so we expected the trail to give out at some point. The previous day's weather had been worse than what we were now dealing with, with cloudy conditions, strong gusts, and sporadic snow. By contrast, we had perfect clear blue skies and a steadily rising sun. All the same, the knowledge that we might be pushing past area where other groups had turned back filled me with trepidation. As we moved back and forth across the switchbakcs we rose in elevation. For the most part it was simple walking. The snow in some areas was about calf deep and relatively dry. Traction was proving to be mostly a non-issue, though always in my mind. In some cases the trail was all but invisible, washed into the hillside by large drifts and discernible only as a slight depression in the surrounding snow. As we climbed, sections of the trail felt less like a walk up a hill and more like a cliff face traverse. Steep embankments of snow and rock fell away mere feet from where we walked, and although the snow felt solid I knew that if I slipped it could be a treacherous and painful tumble before I stopped. My own inclinations to turn around were steadily rising, but Ben's determination and the absence of complaints from the other two left me in the position of simply trekking ahead. On the final switchback before making the ridge we encountered a steep and icy slope, the only thing laying between us and the relative safety of the ridge. Unlike the trail that had taken us to this point, the snow was crusty and required steps to be kicked into it. I was in the lead at this point, but the prospect of kicking steps, something I had never had to do, and the icy slope that fell away several hundred feet to one side, caused me some hesitation. I passed the lead off to Ben, who had by this time taken over wielding the tree branch as his self-arrest device. He proceeded slowly but confidently across the slope, making a series of shallow stepsthat allowed the rest of us to make our way across. That section, in particular, was where I met and crossed over my line of comfort. Had I been on my own, I would've turned around then, if not before. Had someone voiced aloud their desire to turn back, I would've instantly agreed. I am generally not a dramatic person, but I think that I do have an acute awareness of my own mortality. Whatever the actual probability of my slipping and falling off the mountain at that point, I acknowledged it as a very real possibility. Mountains kill people. Part of staying safe in the outdoors is recognizing that nobody is an exception to this. Part of staying safe is knowing the limits of one's own abilities. Part of adventure is pushing those limits. The difficult and dangerous aspect of limits is that it is impossible to know exactly where they lie until they are crossed. And from that there is often no going back.

After crossing the final switchback we rested for a bit and collected ourselves before heading to the junction with the top of the snow chute. There we found a group we had met on the hike to Trail Camp. They had just made it up the snow chute, and two out of the three looked in poor shape, one fellow vomiting up his breakfast onto the snow. It was obvious that they would have to turn back. They asked us if we had any water we could spare, which we didn't. I had a bit of water left in a bottle in my pack, but I had so far gotten by on eating handfuls of snow while walking. For all our underpreparation when it came to gear, we were all quite well prepared in terms of fitness and acclimation. All of us had been living at 5000 feet for the last several months, and the previous two nights we had spent at 8000 feet and 12000 feet, respectively. Consequently, none of us were feeling the ill effects of altitude, other than an obviously quicker tendency to become short of breath. The final stretch of trail from the ridge to the summit would (thankfully, in my eyes) require more of our fitness than of our mountaineering skills, and for that we were more than prepared. Still, the path ahead was in no way easy going. Few people had ventured much further than we had since the snow storm the previous week. The snow was thigh deep in most places, deeper in drifts, and there was in no way a well cut trail. Getting to our current location had taken four hours, making the time at the ridge about 10:30 AM. We had set a turnaround time of 1 PM, and if we weren't at the summit by then we would have to admit defeat. The distance from the ridge junction is about two miles and takes about an hour in good conditions. We were hoping to make it by noon, but we had little information about the trail ahead. Everyone we had talked to thus far had turned back before reaching the summit. Shortly after we started down the trail we meet someone coming back our way. He had turned back as well. "Too tired," he says. So we press on, following his footsteps for a while before finding his turnaround point and forging on ahead. Breaking trail at this elevation is slow going. The snow is soft and deep and we trade off the lead as we slowly progress upwards. The cliffside here falls steeply away in some places, but the trail is not nearly so intimidating as that which we just came up.

The trek takes much longer than it should, or longer than I think it should, in any case. Soon the peak is visible, tantalizingly close. It seems as if I could get there in 5 minutes. In reality it takes us another 45 to wind our way around the steep part of the slope to where it eases a bit. We trudge through the snow and rock hop a bit, inching our way up in elevation. 

### Summit

The peak itself is relatively unpronounced, not a clearly defined prominence, but a rounding of terrain, notable mostly for the fact that there is nowhere left to go, nohere further up, not here, not in this state, not anywhere nearby for thousands of miles.

A peak like Whitney is only half a victory. There is still the journey back down, across steep snowy traverses, down questionable gullies. I have been worried about it since before the trip began.

### Return
