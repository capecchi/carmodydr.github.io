<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>
My current research is focused on the characterization of instabilities in a magnetically confined plasma, and the turbulence that arises as a result. In particular, my work is concerned with the reversed field pinch, a magnetic confinement fusion concept device.
<p>
Turbulence, what Richard Feynman once called 'the most important unsolved problem of classical physics', lies at the heart of many of the most difficult scientific and technological challenges facing fusion researchers. The central goal of the fusion program is to create a highly energetic plasma that is well confined within the walls of the device. This necessitates the existence of steep gradients that separate the hot plasma from the cold walls. These gradients provide sources of free energy that can drive a number of different instabilities, which in turn can grow and interact nonlinearly to create turbulence, sending energy and particles out of the device through turbulent diffusion or reacting back on the original equilibrium and inciting large scale instability.
<p>
Turbulence is a phenomenon that defies the traditional framework of classical physics, which has to a large extent developed to deal with systems that are both simplified (in scale and degrees of freedom) and deterministic. Though turbulence is a classical phenomena, and therefore completely deterministic, the nonlinear nature of the system and the high number of degrees of freedom make it essentially stochastic, and therefore unpredictable (in the sense that the exact state of the system cannot be calculated). The solutions to turbulence do not look like the solutions we might expect but instead are described statistically, by a number of different generalized laws and scaling characteristics. Rather than exact solutions, it is only possible to describe such things as the evolution of statistical quantities and the flow of energy and entropy between scales. 
<p>
Plasma turbulence is particularly challenging, as it lies at the intersection of many different areas of classical physics, drawing from statistical mechanics, electrodynamics, and fluid theory, among others. The fundamental equations for my work are the Boltzmann equation (describing the evolution of the particle distribution function) and Maxwell's laws. To make problems more tractable, simplifications are made to separate the physics at the smallest scales from that at system size. This result of this is the gyrokinetic equation, in which scale separation has been used to remove one degree of freedom from the Boltzmann equation. Current outstanding research questions involve the nature of the instabilities that arise under various conditions and how they affect the movement of particles and energy within a plasma.
<p>
My current work, under my advisor Paul Terry, begins to address some aspects of these questions. We use analytic tools where possible to derive estimates of critical values for instability. However, analytic solutions to the gyrokinetic-Maxwell system of equations are only possible in extremely simplified limits. To obtain more realistic results, it is often necessary to turn to simulations, but due to the multi-scale, multi-dimensional nature of the problem the simulations push beyond the boundaries of most conventional computing environments. As part of my research, we turn to XSEDE (Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment), a collection of computing resources supported by the National Science Foundation. The codes that I use in my research have been developed to take advantage of highly scalable parallel computing environments such as those offered by XSEDE.
