title: Some thoughts on making plots
---

What makes for an **effective** plot? Is this the same thing that makes for a **beautiful** plot?

How do you get a plot to tell a clear story?

Some considerations:
   -   How much information should be included?
   -   How do you separate this information (colors/shapes/etc)?
   -   Elegance (fonts, color palette)
   -   Visual clutter, 1+1=3
